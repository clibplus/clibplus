 <h1>clib+</h1>
 <p>A complete system built-in mixed standard C library package using the minimial libraries that comes with just about any linux OS</p>
</div>

# About

This is a package that extend the minimum linux built-in packages to abstract low-level functions, see more below for more information on the libs created.
Please note that using this package may can increase binary size due to certain libs being used within each-other. Which wouldn't be any difference from using a higher-level language. If you aren't creating application that will proform protection check-sum operation and need better proformance.

<b>Why?</b>

To avoid re-inventing the wheels for future projects and to attract more developer(s) to move to C and have to something to start with that isn't going to kill their motivation in the process of learning when approaching memory management

# Coming Soon

- An application serving as a github-based repo package manager. Allowing you to download certain libs from this organization repo list from linux CMD-Line (ex: ctypes -i net -extra)

- A quick and temporary python script will be made for this until an official version is made...!
